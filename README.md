# Hippo Type

Hippo Type is a minimal and fast typing speed test web app. It allows users to practice and measure their typing speed (WPM) built using basic HTML, CSS and JS.

## Features
- **Typing Test:** Type randomly generated words for 30 seconds and get your WPM (words per minute) score.
- **Live Feedback:** Correct and incorrect letters are highlighted in real-time as you type.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Full keyboard support, including space and backspace for word navigation and corrections.
- **Responsive Design:** Clean, modern UI that works on desktop and mobile.
- **Animated Cursor:** Blinking cursor follows your typing position.
- **Instant Restart:** Start a new game with a single click.

## How It Works
- The app displays a sequence of random words.
- Start typing; the timer begins with your first keystroke.
- Words and letters are colour-coded for correctness.
- At the end of 30 seconds, your WPM is displayed.
- Click "New Game" to try again.
